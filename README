Liquid--
========

Description
-----------

This is a small C++ project, all about computing a fluid simulation in 2D and
rendering it using OpenGL :)


Usage
-----

You can add some dark fluid by left clicking and dragging, and move the fluid
using right click.


Future
------

There is no real roadmap, but I hope I'll make it better / faster later,
starting with some cleanup and refactoring (I adapted the code from a Java
implementation of Jos Stam's method described in “Stable Fluids”).

Maybe I'll even write an OpenCL backend (or make documentation).
